Security key: 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

===================================================================================
# Completed: Falcon Lab V1

Issues: 

1. V reader sensor is not on the ADC pin, cannot get output
2. Accelerometer, gyroscope needs to be changed, from Serial to I2C
3. IMU I2C output needs to be transmitted to another MQTT directory
4. Motor encoders needed to adjust speed PWM, balance both motors
5. Rotational Motors need more torque, and encoders for balance
6. 8 more ADC channels required to communicate with Encoders
